# React vs Angular

So in this course I have built a note app using React, React Router and Redux. I have a similar (actually more or less identical) app that is built with Angular so in this post my thought is to compare the two apps and how the implementation differs between the two. One major difference between the two apps is the backend where my React app uses Firebase as data storage and the Angular app uses a simple node server, but that is not really important since my focus here will be the frontend.

You can find the code for each app here:
[React](https://github.com/ViktorJ/ria-project/tree/gh-pages)
[Angular](https://github.com/ViktorJ/NoteTaker_Angular)

So lets dig in to the code and why not start with the index.html page
React

```
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        //Styles
        <title>Yet Another Note App</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class='container'>
            <div id="content"></div>
        </div>
        //scripts
    </body>
</html>
```

Angular

```
<html ng-app="NoteTaker">
	<head>
		<title>NoteTaker</title>
		<meta charset="utf-8"/>
        		//Styles
	</head>
	<body>

        <div ng-include="'templates/navbar.html'"></div>
        <div ng-view></div>
	
	//Scripts
	</body>
</html>
```

In the React version there is nothing but html in the index file. We create a div that is kind of the starting point for React but at this stage there is nothing that shows that this is a React app.
In the Angular version though we define the app with ng-app and in the body we have both a ng-include directive and a ng-view directive. The ng-include is pretty straightforward and the ng-view is used with ng-route to handle the routing and show the correct template. That brings us to another topic, templates. In React we use Components and in the components we can write javascript (that with JSX looks like html) to display content with the render function. In Angular however we use templates that is pieces of html that can either be static or dynamic if we use different Angular directives with them. These templates are then displayed either with ng-include or associated with a route using ng-route. Lets look at how we define routes:

```
angular.module('NoteTaker').config(function($routeProvider){
    $routeProvider
        .when('/home', {
            templateUrl: 'templates/home.html'
        })
    
        .when('/notes', {
            templateUrl: 'templates/notes.html',
            controller: 'NotesController'
        })
    
        .when('/about', {
            templateUrl: 'templates/about.html'
        })
    
        .otherwise({
            redirectTo: '/home'
        });
});
```
Pretty straightforward stuff and quite similar as to how we define routes with React Router with the difference that in React Router we associate each route with a component instead of a template.

Lets take a look at how we implement the user functionality, that is creating a user and logging in, in the two apps. Lets start with the React app and there we use Redux to accomplish this.

```
const CreateUser = React.createClass({
    handleCreateUser: function(e){
        e.preventDefault();
        
        let user = {
            email   : this.refs.email.value,
            password: this.refs.password.value
        };
        
        this.props.registerUser(user);
    },
    render: function(){
        return (
            <div className="col-sm-6 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
                <h1>New account</h1>
                <h3>Fill in the form and submit to create a new account</h3>
                <form onSubmit={this.handleCreateUser}>
                  <div className="form-group">
                    <input type="text" className="form-control" ref="email" placeholder="Email" />
                  </div>
                  <div className="form-group">
                    <input type="password" className="form-control" ref="password" placeholder="Password" />
                  </div>
                  <button type="submit" className="btn btn-primary">Create</button>
                  <button type="button" className="btn btn-info" onClick={this.props.initial}><Link to="/">Back</Link></button>
                </form>
                <Alert alertClass={this.props.alert.alertClass} alertMsg={this.props.alert.alertMsg}/>
            </div>
        );
    }
});

let mapStateToProps = function(state){
    return {alert:state.alert,
           auth:state.auth};
};

let mapDispatchToProps = function(dispatch){
    return {
        initial: function(){
            dispatch(actions.initial());
        },
        registerUser: function(user){
            dispatch(actions.createUser(user));
        }
    }
};

module.exports = ReactRedux.connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(CreateUser);
```
We have a form were the user types email and password. When the form is submitted we call the handleCreateUser function were we use the forms ref attributes to access the data and pass that to a function registerUser(user), that then dispatches a function to the auth action createUser where the user is created, in this case by calling the firebase function also named createUser(). 

In the Angular app we also have a form, in this case in the navbar template:

```
<div ng-controller="LoginController">
//Omitted code
<form name="signupForm"  ng-submit="signupForm.$valid && addUser()" novalidate>
                  <div class="form-group">
                    <label>Username</label>
                    <input type="username" name="username" ng-model="user.username" class="form-control" placeholder="Enter username" required> 
                  </div>
//More code
```
We have attached the ng-controller=”LoginController” that lets us use the functions in the controller and we take advantage of that in the directive ng-submit="signupForm.$valid && addUser(), if the form is valid call the addUser() function.

```
$scope.addUser = function(){
        var user = $scope.user;
        User.addUser(user)
            .then(function(response){
                if(response === 201){
                    $scope.msg = "Account created, please log in to access the notes.";
                } 
            }, function(response){
                 console.log(response);
                 throw response.status + "  : " + response.statusText;
            });
        $scope.user = {};
    };
```
Scope is kind of the bridge between the controller and the view and lets us share functions between the two and like in this case the user object that contains the information about the user. We make a call to the function addUser(user) in the service User. Services are (according to the docs) used to organize and share code in the app.

```
User.addUser = function(data){
        var request = {
    			method: "POST",
    			url: URL + "users/",
    			data: data
    		};

        return $http(request)
            .then(function(response){
                return response.status;
            }, function(response){
                 console.log(response);
                 throw response.status + "  : " + response.statusText;
            });
    };
```
Here we create a request object that is passed to (the core Angular service) $http that makes a call to the backend server and returns the result.

The login functionality is created pretty much in the same way but there we need to store the information about the user that is logged in. In the React app we do this in the auth reducer

```
const AuthReducer = function(state, action){
    switch(action.type){
        //omitted code
        case C.LOGIN_USER:
            return {
                current: C.LOGGED_IN,
                email: action.email,
                userId: action.uId
            };
	//more code
```
We can now access the user info from state.auth.

In the Angular app we use the controller to save the info, in this app by saving a cookie using local storage

```
$scope.loginUser = function(){
        var user = $scope.user;
          
        User.loginUser(user)
                .then(function(response){
                    localStorage.setItem("loginCookie", response.data);
                    $window.location = 'index.html#/notes';
                }, function(response){
                     console.log(response);
                     throw response.status + "  : " + response.statusText;
                });
        $scope.user = {};
    };
```
To display the notes in the React app we create a Notes component that can access the notes from this.props.notes thanks to our implementation with Redux. We then iterate over the notes with a forEach loop.

```
renderNotes: function(){
        let notes = this.props.notes.data;
        let noteArray = [];
        let key = 0;

        if (notes) {
            let user = this.props.auth.userId;
            notes.forEach(function (note) {
                if(note.user === user){
                    noteArray.push(<div key={key} className="well"><Link to={"/note/" + note.key} key={key++}>
                        {note.title}
                    </Link></div>);
                }
            });
        }

        return noteArray.reverse();
    },
    render: function () {
        return (
            <div className="notes">
                {this.renderNotes()}
            </div>
        );
    }
```

In the Angular app we use ng-repeat and Angulars two-way binding to display the notes. In the controller we have a function getNotes() that calls the function in the noteService with the same name and attach the notes from the server to $scope.notes.

```
angular.module('NoteTaker').controller('NotesController', ['$scope', '$http', 'Note', function($scope, $http, Note){
    
    $scope.notes = {};
    $scope.noteData = {};
    var currentNote = null;
    var token = localStorage.getItem("loginCookie");
    
    getNotes();
    
    /*
    * Get all notes
    *
    */
    function getNotes(){
        Note.getNotes().then(function(response){
                $scope.notes = response;
            }, function(response){
                 console.log(response);
                 throw response.status + "  : " + response.statusText;
        });
    }
//more code
```

```
<h2>Notes</h2>
            <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-unstyled" ng-repeat="note in notes">
                    <div class="panel panel-default">
                        <a href="" ng-click="getNoteById(note)"><div class="panel-body">
                           {{ note.title }}
                        </div></a>
                    </div></li>
            </ul>
```

Thats pretty much it. More or less the same app written in two different frameworks. So which one is better? Well, thats not for me to tell. Actually React is not even a framework but a library to create user interfaces so you may want to combine React with for example Redux and Firebase as I have done with this app if you are to build a web application. Angular is more of the whole package, a MVC framework that comes with a lot of functionality from the start. My view is that React gives you more freedom where Angular requires you to do things the "Angular way". That on the other hand has its pros and cons. Personally I have come to like React when working with it in this course and will probably stick with that for the time beeing.
