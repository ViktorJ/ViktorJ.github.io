# Bug fixed!

I managed to solve the bug that I was talking about in the previous blogpost that caused the notes to not load correctly without a page reload. The problem was in my auth reducer. There I have one function to handle the login and another that listens for auth changes and I was handling successful login in both of them when infact I dont need to do that in the login function since listeningToAuth handles that automagically.

```javascript
    listeningToAuth: function () {
        return function (dispatch, getState) {
            firebaseRef.onAuth(function (authData) {
                if (authData) {
                    dispatch({
                        type: C.LOGIN_USER,
                        email: authData.password.email,
                        uId: authData.uid

                    });
                } else {
                    if (getState().auth.current !== C.ANONYMOUS) {
                        dispatch({type: C.LOGOUT});
                    }
                }
            });
        }
    },
    login: function (user) {
        return function (dispatch, getState) {
            dispatch({type: C.ATTEMPT_LOGIN});

            firebaseRef.authWithPassword(user, function (error, authData) {
                if (error) {
                    console.log("Login Failed!", error);
                    dispatch({type: C.ALERT_FAIL,
                              msg: "Login failed, please try again."});
                } else {
                    //Here I made a dispatch but thats handled by listeningToAuth
                    console.log("Authenticated successfully with email: ", authData.password.email);
                }
            });
        }
    }
```
