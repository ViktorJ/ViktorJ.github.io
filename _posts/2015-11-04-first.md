# First post

Hello there!

My name is Viktor and I am a 32 year old(!) living in Södertälje. I have studied web programming for two years at the Uppsala university and am now studying for a bachelor degree in Computer science at the Linnaeus university. 

I have programmed in a couple of different languages primarily in Java and JavaScript but have basic knowledge of PHP and C# aswell.

Although I have done some JavaScript programming I would certainly not call myself an expert and that is were I hope this course will help me to sharpen my skills. I have used mostly jQuery and Angular before so am looking forward to see what React is like. I have heard mostly good things about it.

I have previously used Sublime as editor but since a couple of months back I have switched to Brackets instead.
