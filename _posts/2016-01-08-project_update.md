# Project update

So its been awhile since I updated about the project and now all the christmas and new year festivities has passed so guess its time for an update.
The project is more or less completed. Of course there are always more futures to add and smoother refactories to be done but I feel pretty happy with the work so far.
There is now possible to create an account, login, write, read, edit and delete notes. The whole app uses React, React Router and Redux.
The new futures that I have implemented since the last update is editing and deleting notes. I have also made some bugfixes like problems with the redirect after login, and some other refactoring like a more generic alert system.
There is still an irritating bug where a page reload has to be done to load the notes correctly the first time after login that I can not get my head around. Guess I have to keep working on that but now my biggest focus is on my deep dive.
