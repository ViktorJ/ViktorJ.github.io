# The project (again...)

So I have not updated the blog about what kind of project I will do. My thought is to create a note app that lets an authorized user add, edit and delete notes. Sounds familiar? Yes, as both David and I realised when we were talking, it very much resembles Davids demo app 2. My hope is though that I will be able to put my own twist on it. One difference is that in my app the users are only going to be able to view their own notes, and hopefully I will come up with some other functions that separates my app from Davids.

I have created a similar app in Angular before, so that is kind of the reason behind doing this, to be able to compare the workflow between React and Angular.
