# Getting to know React

Ok, so this week I have been trying to get a grasp on React. I started off with the talk by Pete Hunt, continued to the JSFiddle on Reacts homepage and then moved on to the tutorial on the same page that shows how to build a simple comments app. I have also played around a little with the demo app on the course page (spiderman always wins) and watched some youtube tutorials. 

My first impressions about React is positive I have to say. I like the "components thinking" and the JSX syntax, but I have still to figure out exactly how components are to communicate with each other. Still a lot of learning left in other words. Next step is to read up on Redux and React Router.

Oh right, I have a simple Hello-world-like app built in React (no Redux and React Router yet) up and running on my projects page that can be found [here](http://viktorj.github.io/ria-project/).
