# Redux and ES2015

I keep finding stuff to do that is not coding on the project but hopefully these things will lead to me being more productive when I actually do start to implement my app.

This week I have focused on Redux and ES2015. 

## Redux

To start getting a grasp on Redux I listened to the JavaScript Jabber podcast where they had Dan Abramov as a guest. I thought it was a good episode that gave a nice background on Redux and what it does. The episode can be found here: [JavaScript Jabber: redux and React with Dan Abramov](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/179-jsj-redux-and-react-with-dan-abramov)

I then proceeded to take a more deeper look on the demo app, this time with focus on redux and also went through Andreas 'Simple React Redux example'. After that I gave it a go to include redux in my own project. It went really smooth I have to say, even though my app has very little state at this point. I can see real maintenance benefits in having the state organised in the way that redux is advocating.

## ES2015

I have also started to dive in to what ES2015 has to offer. I played through the ES2015 course on CodeSchool which I thought was great. In my own app the transformation to ES2015 mostly includes changing 'var' with 'let' but it had some cool features like rest parameters and spread operators that I most likely will use.
