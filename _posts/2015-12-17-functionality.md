# We have functionality!

The app is now (well, it has been for a while actually) up and running. At this stage its possible to create an account, login, write and read notes.
I started out with some static React components just to have a boilerplate to work with. I then proceeded to implement the functionality, and at that point I did not use Redux but handled the state in the React components. The last step was to move the state out of the components and use Redux instead. I cover that part some more [here](http://viktorj.github.io/notes/beauty_of_redux/).
