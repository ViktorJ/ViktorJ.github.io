# The project

At this time I should probably have figured out what to do for the project right? Well, I have not. I have however been working with resources and techniques that I eventually will use in the project so I feel that I am up to speed nevertheless.

I have implemented a login/user function to my hello world app. To help out with that I have hooked up the app with a Firebase database and are using React Router to handle the linking and routing.

I have not used Firebase before but have heard of it and wanted to try it out, so this project will be a perfect chance to do that. I figured out that Firebase has this really smooth functions to work with user authentication. To create a new user all you have to do is:

```javascript
this.firebaseRef = new Firebase('https://yourFirebase.firebaseio.com');

var user = { 
    email   : email,
    password: password
};

var authData = this.firebaseRef.getAuth();

this.firebaseRef.createUser(user, function(error, userData) {
    if (error) {
        console.log("Error creating user:", error);
    } else {
        console.log("Successfully created user account with uid:", userData.uid);
    }
});
```

And that's it really. Once a user is created you can login that user like this:

```javascript
this.firebaseRef = new Firebase('https://yourFirebase.firebaseio.com');

var user = { 
    email   : email,
    password: password
};

var authData = this.firebaseRef.getAuth();

function authHandler(error, authData) {
    if (error) {
        console.log("Login Failed!", error);
    } else {
        console.log("Authenticated successfully with email: ", authData.password.email);
    }
}

this.firebaseRef.authWithPassword(user, authHandler);
```

Firebase also supports user authentication using providers like Facebook, Twitter and Google. I will look in to that in the near future.

React Router was a plesent new tool aswell. I can see that linking and routing will be real smooth using React Router. Linking was super easy, just insert a ``` <Link to="/home">Home</Link> ``` and direct it to the route you want. When I was implementing the login functionality I wanted a redirect after successfull login and that showed to be a little trickier. Thanks to Elins great [blogpost](https://github.com/Swoot1/ria2015/blob/gh-pages/blog/2015-11-14-a-simple-redirect-how-hard-can-it-be.markdown) i managed to solve that too.

So, now I will spend my weekend to think about fun ideas for the project.
