Hello.

My name is Viktor Jansson and this is my blog in the course RIA-development at the Linnaeus university. The object of the course is to do a project in JavaScript using different techniques and frameworks like React, React Router and Redux. 

This blog will be used for documentation about the project as well as other topics that may come to my mind regarding web development.
